            I am a highly skilled Lead Developer and Architect capable of
            operating at all levels across the organisation. My key strength is
            the ability to discuss requirements and ideas with business users
            and envisage the technology solution to meet those demands. With
            over 30 years experience in software development, the last 20 spent
            in the Financial Services sector, I have experience of operating in
            a wide range of businesses, from small software houses to large
            global corporates. My core technology skills include AWS, Ab Initio,
            C#, ASP.Net MVC, Java, SQL as well as a broad exposure to a host of
            other technologies. I was instrumental in introducing Agile and
            SCRUM in my last position, and successfully delivered 2 major
            projects on time and on budget using iterative delivery methods,
            continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to UAT. I
            have a strong background in configuration management, software
            development lifecycles, systems analysis and cybersecurity.
