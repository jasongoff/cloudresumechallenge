            I am a highly skilled Lead Developer and Architect capable of
            operating at all levels across the organisation. My key strength is
            the ability to discuss requirements and ideas with business users
            and envisage the technology solution to meet those demands. With
            over 30 years experience in software development, the last 20 spent
            in the Financial Services sector, I have experience of operating in
            a wide range of businesses, from small software houses to large
            global corporates. My core technology skills include AWS, Ab Initio,
            Python, C#, ASP.Net MVC, Java, SQL as well as a broad exposure to a
            host of other technologies. I was instrumental in introducing Agile
            and SCRUM in my last position, and successfully delivered 2 major
            projects on time and on budget using iterative delivery methods,
            continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to UAT. I
            have a strong background in configuration management, software
            development lifecycles and systems analysis.

            solution in less than 8 weeks. This involved the re-engineering of
            some 200 data interfaces to enable communication with the vendor's

          <p>
            In July 2017, the outsourcing contract with JPMorgan ended and CTI
            decided to take the operation of their Middle Office back in-house.
            Along with a number of colleagues, I transferred back to CTI and
            continued to support the application portfolio, as well as work on a
            number of strategic projects to replace end-of-life systems.

          </p>
          <p>
            In October 2006. Threadneedle Asset Management outsourced it’s Back
            Office functions to JPMorgan, along with some 160 staff. Initially,
            my role was to assimilate our existing practices into the JPMorgan
            framework and ensuring that we were compliant with the wider IT
            Controls that existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the 10 years, the technology team was primarily focussed on
            maintaining the existing mature platform, with small to medium-sized
            enhancements as required by the business. My role was focussed
            around development lead, delivery management and cybersecurity /
            software audit. I was the JPMorgan accredited Application Security
            Champion for my line of business technology team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various organisational changes over that time saw me perform a
            variety of roles including being responsible for budgeting and
            delivery of software changes; design and architecture of solutions;
            being Product Owner for our Ab Initio middleware solution and
            latterly being responsible for the delivery of all technology change
            on the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2011, our main client, CTI, decided to move its Back Office
            functions to Citibank, which resulted in reduced investment in the
            platform and a winding down of the team. My biggest achievements in
            this role have been the introduction of Agile and SCRUM to the team,
            and the design and delivery of the new Unit Dealing platform in
            2016.

            <i>Development Team Manager</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            I was initially engaged by Threadneedle as a contractor to provide
            technical input and support into the Hiportfolio Implementation
            project. After the initial 6 months I was offered a permanent role
            as Senior Developer. During my time in this role, I was responsible
            for technical design and implementation of a reporting data
            warehouse in SQL Server to enable month-end reporting processes to
            access the accounting data from the central Fund Accounting system,
            Hiportfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2004, a reorganisation of the IT department saw me being
            given the role of Development Team Manager. In this role, I had
            responsibility for the overall design and architecture of software
            delivery through a number of small to medium-sized developments into
            the existing production environment. This involved managing a
            project plan with up to 20 concurrent smaller projects running.
            These mini-projects were each manned by one or two members of the
            development team, who had responsibility for the full end-to-end
            lifecycle from requirements gathering through to UAT support.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also designed new configuration management processes, and created
            the role of configuration manager within the department, to provide
            a full-time expert dedicated to package and deployment of solutions
            working within the ITIL change management processes used at
            Threadneedle.
