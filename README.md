# cloudresumechallenge
Repo for artifacts created as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge

I started the challenge in March 2023 as a vehicle for focussing my Cloud learning.

# Notes
Basic notes that I made whilst working through the fantastic [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/) by Forrest Brazeal.

These are broken down into the logical parts that follow the challenge steps.


- [Creating the Organisation](create-org.md)
- [Certification Prep](certprep.md)
- [Chunk 1 - The Front End](frontend.md)
- [Chunk 2 - Building the API](api.md)

Phew! So far so good!  Now on page 82, nearly ready for Chunk 2!
